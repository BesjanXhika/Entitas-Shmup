- how you can use reactive system to only process changed entities
- the usage of EntityIndex for super fast entity access
- how you can use multiple pools to reduce the memory footprint of each entity (Input, Core, Score)
- how you can use external logic like Unity Physics and Input
- how you can do GameObject object pooling
- that Entitas is perfect for TDD (Test Driven Development)
